# Azure Data Engineering — Learning Journal

## What This Is
This is NOT a tutorial repo. This is my actual, honest learning journal
as I transition from SQL/Azure SQL engineering into full Azure Data Engineering.

Every mistake I make. Every thing that clicks. Every project I build.
Documented publicly.

## Why I'm Doing This
I spent years in Azure SQL at HCL. Now I'm building pipelines.
Instead of pretending I know everything, I'm showing exactly how I learn.

## Current Status
- [x] Azure foundations (Storage, Networking basics)
- [x] Azure Data Factory — first pipeline
- [ ] Databricks — first notebook
- [ ] Synapse — first query
- [ ] Delta Lake — first table
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline (SQL → ADLS → Databricks → Synapse)

## My Stack
- SQL (T-SQL) — my strongest skill
- Python
- Azure (ADF, ADLS Gen2, Databricks, Synapse)

## Structure
Each folder = one Azure service or concept.
Inside = my notes, code attempts, what broke, what worked.
